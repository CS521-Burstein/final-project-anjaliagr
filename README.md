# Team-Project
We are choosing an open-ended question. Our data is from the world bank and looks at the relationship between GDP per capita and CO2 emissions per capita (controlling for time and fixed effects). 
This is panel data across 217 countries from 1960-2020 (constant 2015USD).
We are also planning on adding other variables such as urban population, energy exports, and carbon intensity to extend our analysis and investigate policy recommendations.
