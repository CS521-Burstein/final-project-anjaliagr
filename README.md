# Team-Project
We are choosing an open-ended question. Our data is from the world bank and looks at the relationship between GDP per capita and CO2 emissions per capita (controlling for time and fixed effects). 
This is panel data across 217 countries from 2000-2019 (constant 2015USD).
Use the programmatic data download to access the data set and the data analysis python file to see the coding for our project
