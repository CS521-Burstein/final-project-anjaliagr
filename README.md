# Team-Project
We are choosing an open-ended question. Our data is from the world bank and looks at the relationship between GDP per capita and CO2 emissions per capita (controlling for time and fixed effects). 
This is panel data across 217 countries from 1960-2020 (constant 2015USD).
We are also planning on adding other variables such as urban population, energy exports, and carbon intensity to extend our analysis and investigate policy recommendations. 

Questions/ Comments:

We have been unable to run the basic regressions as we are still figuring out the best way to remove missing values
We are also confused on the error we are getting while running the regression after dropping nulls. 
Can you share some suggestions on what would be the best strategy to clean and view the full data before diving deep?
We have done some preliminary analaysis wiht plots using mostly pooled data
The plan is to mostly include all variables that effect climate and their effect on gdp
We would be using fixed effects as controls
